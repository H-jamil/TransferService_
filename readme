**Transfer Service


A Socket communication based file transfer service that dynamically changes the number of TCP streams based on network traffic condition

The application can only correctly function on Linux-based operating systems due to several Linux-based functional dependencies. There are two configuration files for specifying the source, destinations, maximum allowed thread, and many other options.

Please use python3 and install necessary packages using the requirements.txt file, preferably in a virtual environment, to avoid package version conflicts.

Below steps are required for both source and destination server:

After cloning do ```python
chmod +x environment_installation.sh
```
then run ```python
sudo ./environment_installation.sh transferEnv 3.10
```
&        ```python
source ~/.bashrc
```
if above command gives error and doesn't complete do ```python
source ~/.bashrc
``` and then run **sudo ./environment_installation.sh transferEnv 3.10**
&       ** source ~/.bashrc** again.
create a source file directory by running ```python
file_creation.sh </src/directory> <#of_file> <eachfileSize>
```
Activate transferEnv using ```python
pyenv activate transferEnv
```
Install required python packages: ```python
pip install -r requirements.tx
```
On the destination server, please edit config_receiver.py and run python receiver.py
On the source server, please edit config_sender.py and run python sender.py
